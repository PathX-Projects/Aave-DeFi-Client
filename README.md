# Aave DeFi Client for Web3.py

> NOTE: This is the beta version of the client. More docs to come...
 
## Setup

Please install or have installed the following:

1. Install the pip package requirements from the `requirements.txt` file
2. Make sure that you have a working RPC url for your target network. Currently the client supports the Ethereum Kovan Testnet and Mainnet. If you do not have an RPC url, you can use [Infuria.io](https://infura.io/) 

## Important Repository Information:
- The only dependencies for usage of the aave_client are the package requirements (in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/PathX-Projects/Aave-DeFi-Client/blob/main/requirements.txt)), and the [`aave_client.py`](https://github.com/PathX-Projects/Aave-DeFi-Client/blob/main/aave_client.py) file.
- You can find examples of the client's functionality in the [`usage_examples`](https://github.com/PathX-Projects/Aave-DeFi-Client/tree/main/usage_examples) folder.
- You can safely move the [`aave_client.py`](https://github.com/PathX-Projects/Aave-DeFi-Client/blob/main/aave_client.py) file to different directories and use it with no issues, as long as the package requirements are satisfied.
